# LineExtraction Development Guide

This repository uses [cmake](https://https://cmake.org/) as the primary build system and [Bazel](https://bazel.build/) as the potential next build system.
The code is written in C++ and Python, and the primary IDE used is [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
