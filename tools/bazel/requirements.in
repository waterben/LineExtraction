# Direct pip dependencies required by Bazel Python targets.
#
# This is the INPUT file — do NOT edit requirements_lock.txt manually.
# Instead, edit this file and regenerate the lockfile:
#
#   uv pip compile tools/bazel/requirements.in \
#       -o tools/bazel/requirements_lock.txt \
#       --python-version 3.12
#
# These packages are a subset of pyproject.toml [project.dependencies].
# Only packages used by Bazel py_test / py_binary targets belong here.
